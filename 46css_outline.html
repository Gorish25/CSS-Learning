<!--
    CSS has the following outline properties:

outline-style
outline-color
outline-width
outline-offset
outline
  -->

<!--  Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline. -->
