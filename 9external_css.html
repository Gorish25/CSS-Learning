<!-- Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS
 -->

<!-- External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>External CSS</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="9css.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
