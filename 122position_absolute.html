<!--  absolute;An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements. -->
